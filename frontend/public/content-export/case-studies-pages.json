The reliance on manual processes limited scalability and prevented 24/7 customer support, impacting user satisfaction and operational efficiency. Existing knowledge was often fragmented within WhatsApp chat messages, making it difficult to provide standardized and timely responses.</p> \n</div>\n\n<div class= \"case-study-card-item\">\n\n <h4>Solution</h4> \n <p>We developed a multi-modal, multilingual <b>(99+ languages)</b> WhatsApp chatbot that automates customer interactions across text, audio, and image formats. We leveraged AI based intent recognition to categorize user's query and a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to prepare most accurate response based on private organizational data. Our solution also includes intelligent human escalation for complex queries, ensuring seamless service continuity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class= \"case-study-card-item\">\n\n<h4>Benefits</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Enabled 24/7 automated customer support in their native language.</li>\n<li>Significantly reduced human agent workload.</li>\n<li>Provided scalable handling of high query volumes.</li>\n<li>Ensured consistent and standardized information delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<p>\nIn today's fast-paced digital landscape, organizations face immense pressure to deliver instant, accurate, and scalable customer support across multiple channels. Traditional human-centric service models often struggle with 24/7 availability, high operational costs, and the inefficiency of repetitive tasks. This project addressed the critical need for an intelligent, automated solution that could offload routine inquiries, enhance service accessibility, and empower human agents to focus on complex, high-value interactions.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The client, exemplified by an accountancy firm, faced challenges in providing consistent information on courses, fees, and payment processes. Their existing knowledge base was primarily embedded within human agent chat logs, making it difficult to centralize and leverage for automated responses. This fragmented knowledge hindered efficient information retrieval and dissemination.</p>\n<p>Human agents worked in shifts, leading to limited availability and inconsistent service delivery. The firm needed a system that could handle diverse query types—text, audio, and images—and accurately distinguish between general chat, irrelevant messages, and specific organizational data queries. A significant hurdle was the inability of automated systems to verify sensitive actions like payment confirmations, necessitating a robust human escalation process.</p>\n<p>End-users required immediate and accurate answers to their queries, expecting seamless interactions across various communication modes. Human agents were burdened with repetitive tasks and the manual effort of extracting and sharing knowledge.

It leverages advanced intent recognition and a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide precise answers from private organizational data, seamlessly escalating complex queries to human agents. The system offers flexible knowledge base onboarding, including learning from existing chat histories and integrating with document repositories. This has resulted in enhanced 24/7 availability, significant scalability improvements, and a reduction in the repetitive workload for human support teams.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Key Business Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>High operational costs associated with maintaining a large human agent workforce for routine inquiries.</li>\n<li>Limited scalability of human-operated service centers, leading to delays during peak demand.</li>\n<li>Inconsistent customer experiences due to varying agent knowledge and availability across shifts.</li>\n<li>Inefficient knowledge management, with critical organizational data fragmented across chat logs and diverse documents.</li>\n<li>Inability to provide 24/7 customer support, impacting global reach and user satisfaction.</li>\n<li>Manual and time-consuming processes for updating and disseminating new organizational information.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Solution Overview</h2>\n<p>The solution is a multi-modal, multilingual WhatsApp chatbot, supporting text, audio, and image inputs and outputs. It employs a sophisticated intent recognition engine to categorize user queries, distinguishing between general chat, irrelevant messages, and specific organizational data requests. For relevant queries, it activates a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.</p>\n<p>The RAG pipeline converts private organizational data into Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and stores them in a <a href=\"https://milvus.io/\">Milvus</a> vector database. For the user's query related to organizational data, the system performs a semantic search to retrieve top-matching answers. A similarity score threshold determines the quality of the match; if below the threshold, or if the user explicitly requests it, the query is seamlessly escalated to a human agent.</p>\n<p>Knowledge base onboarding is highly flexible. Organizations can upload documents (PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, Word) for automatic conversion into FAQs. Alternatively, for existing service channels, the chatbot can either retrieve last 6 months of chat history (if available), or listen to human agent interactions over approximately one month to absorb and convert chat histories into a structured knowledge base.</p>\n<p>The backend utilizes a microservice architecture, with offline, production-grade LLM deployment powered by <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/\">vLLM</a> for low latency, scalability, and data privacy. Minio or S3 is used for object storage of user-sent images and voice notes. The platform also offers multi-model support, integrating with <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://gemini.google/\">Gemini</a>, <a href=\"https://grok.com/\">Grok</a>, and locally hosted models. An administrative portal provides comprehensive analytics, including user statistics, chat durations, demographics, and topic popularity, enabling continuous improvement of the knowledge base. The system also integrates with Google Sheets and other interfaces for scheduled or on-demand updates to the organizational knowledge base, ensuring information remains current.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Outcomes and Impact</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>24/7 Availability:</strong> The chatbot provides continuous, round-the-clock customer support, eliminating time zone limitations.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Scalability:</strong> Capable of handling thousands of concurrent users, significantly exceeding human agent capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Operational Costs:</strong> Automates repetitive inquiries, freeing human agents to focus on complex, high-value tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Data Access:</strong> Centralized knowledge base ensures quick and consistent access to organizational information.</li>\n<li><strong>Data-Driven Optimization:</strong> Admin dashboard provides detailed analytics on user satisfaction and query trends, guiding knowledge base enhancements.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Knowledge Management:</strong> Seamless integration for document-based or chat-history-based knowledge onboarding and updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-modal User Experience:</strong> Supports text, audio, and image interactions, catering to diverse user preferences.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure Data Handling:</strong> Offline LLM deployment and private vector database (<a href=\"https://milvus.io/\">Milvus</a>) ensure data privacy and security.</li>\n<li><strong>Pilot Results:</strong> An accountancy firm successfully deployed the chatbot to answer course fees and payment guidance, with payment verification efficiently escalated to human agents.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n",

The need for secure, efficient, and accurate information retrieval from internal knowledge bases is paramount for informed decision-making, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency. This project addressed the critical demand for a system that can intelligently process diverse data formats while maintaining strict data privacy and providing verifiable insights.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The client operates in an environment rich with diverse digital content, including PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Markdown, plain text files, and online resources. Extracting specific, accurate information from this fragmented data landscape was a significant hurdle. Traditional search methods often failed to provide precise answers or context, leading to time-consuming manual data retrieval.</p>\n<p>A key challenge involved processing complex document structures, such as multi-sheet Excel files, where data needed to be extracted, structured, and made queryable. Similarly, scanned documents and images required advanced processing to extract text and integrate it into the knowledge base. The client also prioritized data privacy, necessitating solutions that could operate securely, potentially on-premises, without compromising sensitive information.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders, from individual users needing quick answers to administrators managing user access and data, required a system that was intuitive, scalable, and reliable. The existing infrastructure lacked the capability to handle simultaneous processing tasks efficiently or to offer granular control over user features and document limits.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<p>Our solution implemented a sophisticated RAG pipeline to transform diverse unstructured data into a queryable knowledge base. Leveraging a microservice architecture, files are processed through dedicated pipelines, stored in object storage (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">AWS S3</a> or <a href=\"https://min.io/\">MinIO</a>), and indexed in a <a href=\"https://milvus.io/\">Milvus</a> vector database. To ensure scalability, low latency, and complete data privacy, we incorporated offline, production-grade LLM deployment using <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/\">vLLM</a>, enabling high-throughput inference without relying on external APIs. This system empowers users to ask natural language questions and receive precise, cited answers, significantly enhancing information access and data utilization across the organization.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Key Business Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty in extracting structured data from complex documents like multi-sheet Excel files, leading to manual effort and potential errors in analysis.</li>\n<li>Lack of a unified system to query information across diverse document formats and online resources, hindering efficient knowledge retrieval and decision-making.</li>\n<li>Inability to provide precise, cited answers to user queries, impacting trust in information and requiring manual verification processes.</li>\n<li>Concerns regarding data privacy and security, necessitating options for on-premises deployment and offline functionality to meet compliance requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Solution Overview</h2>\n<p>The solution is built on a microservice architecture with dedicated data processing pipelines. When a user uploads a document, it is stored in object storage, and its metadata—including file name, type, and user association—is recorded in a central database for tracking. A processing job is then created and pushed to a message queue (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.rabbitmq.com/\">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Apache Kafka</a>, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">AWS SQS</a>), which distributes tasks across processing services. Based on resource availability, jobs are dynamically scheduled and executed, enabling scalable, fault-tolerant, and parallel processing of files while ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization.</p>\n<p>The system supports a wide array of document formats, including PDF, DOC/DOCX, Markdown, TXT, XLS/XLSX, and images, as well as online resources such as websites and Google Docs. Each format is handled through a dedicated parsing pipeline. For instance, with Excel files, data is extracted from every sheet, converted into a structured format, and stored in the database. The processed and structured data is then embedded into a <a href=\"https://milvus.io/\">Milvus</a> vector database for fast, semantic querying.</p>\n<p>To ensure low latency, scalability, and complete data privacy, the platform uses offline, production-grade LLM deployment powered by <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/\">vLLM</a>, enabling high-throughput inference without relying on third-party APIs. Users can query one or multiple documents and receive precise, cited answers with page numbers and exact content locations. The system further enhances the user experience with clickable references, read-aloud functionality, and answer regeneration. It also provides multi-model support, allowing seamless integration with <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://gemini.google/\">Gemini</a>, <a href=\"https://grok.com/\">Grok</a>, and locally hosted models to offer flexible and diverse AI capabilities. This architecture provides the flexibility for both cloud-hosted and on-premises deployments, meeting diverse enterprise data privacy and regulatory compliance needs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"case-study-section\">\n<h2>Outcomes and Impact</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enabled Natural Language Querying:</strong> Enabled natural language querying across diverse document types, including complex Excel sheets and scanned documents.</li>\n<li><strong>Delivered Precise Citations:</strong> Delivered precise, page-level citations for answers, enhancing trust and verifiability of information.</li>\n<li><strong>Supported Flexible Deployment:</strong> Supported flexible deployment options—including cloud, on-premises, and offline production-grade LLM deployment using <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/\">vLLM</a>—to meet diverse data privacy and control requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Multiple AI Models:</strong> Integrated multiple AI models (<a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://gemini.google/\">Gemini</a>, <a href=\"https://grok.com/\">Grok</a>, and locally hosted models), providing flexibility and future-proofing for advanced capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined Information Access:</strong> Streamlined information access and knowledge retrieval from private data sources, significantly reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n",
